## Introduction

This week, we will interrogate our models further. There is no code to follow but there are objectives. For each objective, output one figure that can explain your results.

### Objective 1
Fit kNN to the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and determine the optimal *k* value. See kNN_plot file in the repo. 

### Objective 2
Fit a Decision Tree to the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and plot the decision tree. See this page for help: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html

### Objective 3
Fit RandomForest to the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and determine the top 3 important features. See this page for help: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html 

### Objective 4
Fit Extremely Randomised Trees to the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and determine the top 3 important features. How do the results compare to RandomForest?

### Objective 5
Fit Adaptive Boosting to the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and determine the top 3 important features. How do the results compare to the other tree-based learners?

### Objective 6
Fit PCA to the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and plot the results in a 2D plot. Do you see an obvious cluster?

### Final Objective
Answer the following question: Which learner was the best performer?
